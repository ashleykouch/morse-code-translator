# Morse-Code-Translator

{add test badges here, all projects you build from here on out will have tests, therefore you should have github workflow badges at the top of your repositories: [Github Workflow Badges](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/adding-a-workflow-status-badge)}

## Requirements / Purpose

### MVP

- Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English Text or some Morse Code.
- Create JS functions that would allow the user to:

  - translate their English text into Morse Code
  - translate their Morse Code into English text

- Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters).
- Detect if a piece of text is english or morse and translate accordingly.
- Split code between data, logic functions and DOM functions.
- Develop unit tests for all logic functions
- Explore and discover edge cases in code to develop tests.

### Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to create a webpage Morse Code translator which translates the user input from english to morse and vice versa in real time. The focus of this project will be putting the code into modules and creating unit tests. The UI will look visually appealing and simple.

### Tech Stacks Used

HTML: HTML provides a way to structure content using semantic elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists and tables. By using these elements, we can create a well-organised and accessible web page that is easy to understand and navigate.

SCSS: As a preprocessor for CSS, SCSS allows us to write more maintainable and modular stylesheets. With SCSS, we can use variables, mixins, and functions to avoid repeating code, making it easier to change the style of the web page.

JavaScript: A programming language that allows us to add interactivity and dynamic behaviour to the web page. We can create event listeners to respond to user actions such as clicking buttons or entering text, and you can manipulate the DOM to update the content of the web page in real time.

Morse code translation logic: The Morse code translator requires some computational logic to be implemented for translating the input text to its equivalent Morse code and vice versa. Using JavaScript allows us to provide the necessary programming constructs and operations to implement the logic.

Furthermore, HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript are commonly used technologies for web development, and there are many tools and frameworks available to help build and deploy web applications. Using these technologies allows us to take advantage of these resources and ensure the application is compatible with a wide range of web browsers and devices.

## Build Steps

There are no installations or requirements to run the project. As the project has been deployed, it can be accessed straight through the hosting link.

However, if the portfolio is downloaded, simply open the 'index.html' file in any preferred web browser to view.

## Design Goals / Approach

- The translator should have a simple and intuitive user interface that is easy to use.
- The user should be able to enter any text they want to translate whether it be english or morse.
- The translated text should be displayed in a clear and easy-to-read format
- The user should be able to easily cope the translated Morse Code to the clipboard.
- The translator should be responsive and work well on different screen sizes.

## Features

- A translation engine that converts the text entered by the user into Morse code and vice versa in real time (ie. as the user types).
- A sample alphabetical translation for users who don't know Morse code.
- A display area that shows the translated text to the user.
- A simple and intuitive user interface that is easy to use.
- Responsiveness design that works well on different screen sizes.
- Visual feedback for the user, such as showing the progress of the translation or highlighting any errors

## Known issues

## Future Goals

- Add more languages to be translated to morse code (either directly or by first translating the language to english then effectively to morse).
- Develop a more user friendly UI
- Fix the design and make it more visually appealing with better colour palettes.

---

## What did you struggle with?

- Responsiveness of the website: Getting the HTML elements to fit well on a mobile screen.
- Javascript logic: It was the first javascript project provided by \_nology and it was difficult to get the logic working and implementing the DOM functionalities.
